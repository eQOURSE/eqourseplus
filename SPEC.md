# eQOURSE+ — SaaS Requirements Specification (SPEC.md) v2.1 — Global Edition
> Workforce & Project Delivery Platform for eQOURSE (AI Data Services + Content Services) and Tutrain.
> This file is the single source of truth for AI coding agents (Antigravity / Cursor / Claude Code / Kiro).
> RULES FOR AGENTS: Implement only requirements listed here, by FR ID. Never invent endpoints, entities or
> features not defined here. State machines (Section 6) are law.
> STRUCTURE: Part A = Sections 1–13 (core spec). PART B (Sections 14–21, bottom of file) = Global Edition
> additions. WHERE PART B CONFLICTS WITH PART A, PART B WINS — notably: MongoDB Atlas (Sec 19) replaces
> PostgreSQL, and the deployment/stack in Sections 19–20 replaces Section 11's infra rows.

## 1. Purpose
Single reference for building eQOURSE+ — an Outlier.ai/DataPlus-style platform where freelancers and vendor
agencies register, get KYC/KYB-verified, pass proctored category tests, join a tiered talent pool, and execute
projects end to end: staffing → tasks → QA → delivery → invoicing → payouts. Every requirement has a unique ID
(e.g., FR-REG-03). Reference IDs in branches (`feat/FR-REG-03-kyc-adapter`), PRs and agent prompts.

## 2. Product Overview & Goals
One multi-tenant platform, two business units (eQOURSE, Tutrain), one shared verified talent pool.
Chain: Register → Verify (KYC/KYB) → Proctored Test → Talent Pool → Staffing → Execution → QA → Delivery → Invoicing → Payout.
Success metrics: <10 human-minutes per approved freelancer (2 touch points), staffing <48h, first-pass QA ≥90%,
payout disputes <1%, 100% projects with live margin tracking, fraud flags <2% of pool.

## 3. Roles
Freelancer · Vendor (agency) · Vendor Member · Verifier · Project Manager (PM) · QA Reviewer · Finance Admin ·
Super Admin · Client (Phase 3, read-only portal). RBAC is mandatory; roles scoped per business unit.

## 4. Architecture
Modular monolith at MVP: NestJS API + PostgreSQL, module boundaries = {Identity/RBAC, Onboarding/KYC-KYB,
Assessment/Proctoring, Talent DB/Match, Projects/Jobs/Tasks, QA/Quality, Finance, CRM, Messaging/Notifications,
Audit/Compliance}. All third-party capabilities behind provider-agnostic adapters: KYC (IDfy/HyperVerge),
e-sign (Digio/Leegality), proctoring SDK (Mettl/AutoProctor), payouts (RazorpayX/Cashfree; Stripe overseas),
annotation (Label Studio/CVAT), LLM APIs.

## 6. Normative Flows & State Machines
Implement as explicit enums + transition guards (no ad-hoc booleans).

**F1 Freelancer onboarding:** Sign-up → Profile wizard → KYC docs → Bank penny-drop → e-sign →
auto API checks → HUMAN Verifier (touch 1) → [fail: More-Info loop] → Test invite → Proctored test →
auto-score + HUMAN flag review (touch 2) → [fail: 14-day cooldown, max 2 retakes] → APPROVED (badge+tier) → auto-match.

**F2 Vendor:** Sign-up → KYB docs → signatory KYC + MSA → capability profile → Verifier approval → ACTIVE →
invite members (KYC-lite + tests). RFP: PM posts → vendors bid → PM compares/awards → escrow lock + work order → vendor allocates tasks to members.

**F3 Project lifecycle:** CRM Won → PM creates project → staffing mode {open board | auto-match invites | vendor RFP} →
selection pipeline → work orders e-signed → task batches distributed → execution + gold tasks + sampling QA →
QA gate (accept/rework) → deliverable → client acceptance → client invoice → payouts (TDS/GST) → scorecards archived.

**F4 Task states:** QUEUED → IN_PROGRESS → SUBMITTED → {IN_QA | AUTO_ACCEPT} ; IN_QA → {ACCEPTED | REWORK → SUBMITTED | REJECTED};
IN_PROGRESS → EXPIRED → requeue.

**F5 Finance:** Accepted work → EarningLine → cycle close → auto TDS/GST → Finance batch approval →
payout API → webhook success/fail (fail → retry queue) → worker dashboard + payslips; margin analytics fed continuously.

## 7. Screen Inventory (prototype = production components: Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)

## 13. Agent Rules (repeat)
One FR per session; prompt with FR ID + relevant sections + acceptance criterion; tests before merge;
state machines as enums+guards; adapters for all third parties; no new deps without tech-lead approval;
never touch payments/KYC adapters without human review; branches `feat/FR-XXX-nn-name`; PRs list FR IDs.

---

# PART B — v2.0 ADDENDUM (Global Edition) — WHERE B CONFLICTS WITH A, B WINS

## 14. Global KYC/KYB
Country selector at sign-up (FR-REG-11) drives document checklist + contract entity (India → eQOURSE India;
rest of world → eQOURSE PTE LTD Singapore). Primary IDV: one global provider (Sumsub/Onfido/Persona/Veriff/Stripe
Identity — doc authenticity + selfie liveness + face match + AML/sanctions) behind KYCAdapter (FR-REG-12);
India fast-path via IDfy/HyperVerge. Universal fallback: passport + liveness + proof of address + manual lane.
KYB by region: India GST/PAN/Udyam; US Incorporation+EIN+W-9; UK Companies House+VAT; EU VIES VAT; SG ACRA/UEN;
RoW incorporation+taxID+bank proof (FR-REG-13). All vendors: signatory KYC, UBO≥25% declaration + sanctions
screening, MSA e-sign (DocuSign/Dropbox Sign international; Digio/Leegality India — one ESignAdapter).
Tax profile per user/vendor (FR-REG-14): residency, TIN ref, forms (W-8/W-9/GST), withholding rule id.

## 15. Global Payments
Corridors: India → RazorpayX/Cashfree; International → Wise Platform or Payoneer; Stripe Connect where it fits;
PayPal fallback. Multi-currency EarningLines with FX snapshot at cycle close (FR-FIN-08); provider routing by
corridor behind PayoutAdapter with unified webhooks (FR-FIN-09); withholding rules engine keyed by
(payer entity, payee residency, payee type) (FR-FIN-10). Fee-bearer policy configurable per corridor.

## 16. Screens (build order)
PUBLIC (SSR, SEO): Home / Jobs (/jobs, /jobs/[slug] with JobPosting schema) / For Freelancers / For Vendors /
About-Trust / Login / Register (role question → Freelancer|Vendor wizard; country select).
FREELANCER: register → verify → country → 5-step profile wizard → per-country KYC step (live status chips) →
payout setup → e-sign → under-review (SLA countdown) → Test Center (proctoring pre-check) → proctored test →
result (badge/tier or cooldown) → Dashboard (tier badge, quality ring, earnings, next payout, recommended jobs)
→ Workbench (task center, SOP side panel, timer, rework banner).
VENDOR: company register → KYB checklist → signatory KYC → capability → MSA → dashboard → Team mgmt
(email/CSV invites, member KYC/test/quality table) → allocation board (drag task groups, capacity bars) →
RFP list/detail → bid composer → tracker.
PM (coordinator; no margin/finance visibility): My Projects, New-project wizard (budget over limit → SA approval),
Talent Search (+semantic bar), Staffing kanban (+auto-match panel), Project Room (Overview/Tasks/QA/People/Files/
Chat), Delivery. SUPER ADMIN: command-center home (revenue+margin, funnel, risk, payout liability, fraud, SLA),
Users&Roles (audited impersonation), verification oversight, taxonomy+test builder, finance control (batch
approvals, withholding, entities), automation rules, integrations health, feature flags, audit explorer,
announcements, unified Approvals inbox; assigns coordinators to projects.

## 17. AI vs Manual
AI: parsing, IDV checks, proctoring flags, auto-match, semantic search, distribution, gold accuracy, AI QA
pre-score, fraud anomalies, withholding+FX, payout reconciliation, programmatic SEO pages.
HUMAN (irreversible): flagged-profile approval, flagged-test results, selection/award, borderline QA,
payout batch approval, suspensions/appeals, client acceptance. Rule: AI proposes; humans approve anything irreversible.

## 18. SEO & Domain
Host at **plus.eqourse.com** (subdomain: inherits brand/authority via links, isolates app SEO risk from main site).
No new standalone domain. Crawlable links from eqourse.com header/footer/homepage → subdomain; platform footer
links back ("eQOURSE+ — the talent platform by eQOURSE") + contextual category↔service interlinks. No copied
content (canonical to eqourse.com if unavoidable). Standards: titles ≤60 chars keyword-first; metas ≤155;
self-canonicals; clean slugs; schema = Organization(parentOrganization: eQOURSE) + WebSite + JobPosting (every job
→ Google Jobs) + FAQPage + BreadcrumbList; hreflang en/x-default; SSR/SSG public routes; auto sitemap on publish;
robots blocks /app,/api; separate GSC property; CWV budget LCP<2.5s. FR-SEO-01: programmatic pages per open job and
per category×language landing.

## 19. MongoDB Atlas (system of record — replaces Postgres)
Org eQOURSE; projects eqplus-dev/staging/prod; M0 dev, M10+ prod in AWS ap-south-1 (+SG replica later);
continuous backups; SCRAM users least-privilege; IP allowlist/VPC peering only; CSFLE/Queryable Encryption on PII;
Atlas Search (talent facets) + Atlas Vector Search (semantic). Mongoose strict schemas + collection validators;
migrate-mongo. Collections mirror Section 8 entities (users, freelancerProfiles, vendors, vendorMembers,
documentsVault[files in R2], tests, testAttempts, skillTaxonomy, clients, projects, jobPosts, applications,
workOrders, taskBatches, tasks, qaReviews, earningLines[APPEND-ONLY], payoutBatches, invoices, milestones,
auditLogs[APPEND-ONLY], notifications, announcements, messages). MANDATORY: multi-document transactions for all
ledger/payout writes; state machines as enums + service-layer guards. If finance outgrows Mongo, isolate ledger
into small Postgres service later via adapter.

## 20. Deployment (no physical servers)
Vercel (Next.js, plus.eqourse.com CNAME, PR previews) · Railway/Render (NestJS API + BullMQ workers; Docker;
ap-south-1/SG) · Upstash Redis · MongoDB Atlas · Cloudflare R2 (buckets: kyc-docs encrypted-private,
project-assets, deliverables; pre-signed URLs) · Resend/SES + MSG91/WhatsApp Cloud · Auth0 or Keycloak ·
GitHub Actions CI/CD (prod migrations manual-gated) · Secrets: Doppler → synced to Vercel/Railway; never in repo;
per-env sandbox keys (all providers have sandboxes — staging uses them) · Sentry + BetterStack + Atlas alerts.

## 21. Naming & Phases (solo engineer + AI agents)
Name **eQOURSE+** at plus.eqourse.com; byline "the talent platform by eQOURSE"; Tutrain = business unit,
white-label in Phase 3. Phases (exit-criterion gated): 0 Foundation (wk1–2: repo/auth/Atlas/Doppler/pipelines) →
1 Public site+SEO (wk3–4) → 2 Freelancer onboarding REG-01..07,11,12,14 (wk5–8) → 3 Test gate TST-01..06 (wk9–11)
→ 4 Talent DB+projects TAL-01..03, PRJ-01..07 (wk12–16) → 5 QA+finance core QLT-01, FIN-01..04,08 (wk17–20) →
6 Vendors REG-08/09/13, PRJ-09, FIN-05/06 (wk21–24) → 7 Autonomy TAL-04/05, QLT-02/03, FIN-09, ADM-04..06,
open board (wk25–30) → 8 AI+CRM (31+). Never start a phase before the previous exit criterion runs on staging.

## 22. Foundation & Public-Site Requirements (Phase 0–1 FR IDs — added v2.1)

### 22.1 Foundation (FND) — Phase 0, in this order
| ID | Requirement | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| FR-FND-01 | [P1] Turborepo scaffold: apps/web (Next.js 14 App Router, TS, Tailwind, shadcn init), apps/api (NestJS Node 20, Mongoose, GET /health), packages/shared (state enums from Flows F1/F4/F5 + zod schemas), packages/adapters (KYC/ESign/Payout/Proctor/Storage/LLM interfaces + sandbox implementations only), packages/ui (tokens: primary #F59E0B, text #1E293B, Inter/Plus Jakarta Sans). | `pnpm dev` runs web+api; `pnpm test` and `pnpm lint` green; /health returns 200. |
| FR-FND-02 | [P1] Auth core: email OTP sign-in, JWT access+refresh, roles enum, RBAC route guard, rate-limit on auth endpoints. | Tests prove 401 unauthenticated, 403 wrong-role, 200 correct-role. |
| FR-FND-03 | [P1] Database wiring: Atlas dev connection via env, migrate-mongo configured, seed script inserting skillTaxonomy sample tree. | Migration + seed run cleanly against the dev cluster; no credentials in repo. |
| FR-FND-04 | [P1] CI: GitHub Actions on PR = lint + test + build; merge to main = staging deploy hook. | A failing test blocks the PR check. |
| FR-FND-05 | [P1] Deployments: web on Vercel (or CF Workers), api container on GCP Cloud Run asia-south1, full stack on Utho via Dokploy as staging; health checks + envs from secret manager. | Hello-world reachable on staging and prod URLs; secrets absent from repo. |
| FR-FND-06 | [P1] Observability: Sentry on web+api, structured JSON logs, request-id propagation. | A deliberately thrown error appears in Sentry from both apps. |

### 22.2 Public site (PUB) — Phase 1, after all FND
| ID | Requirement | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| FR-PUB-01 | [P1] Home `/` per Section 16.1 (hero, trust strip, how-it-works, category grid, stats, testimonials, footer with eqourse.com links). | SSR; Lighthouse SEO ≥95; meta/canonical per Section 18. |
| FR-PUB-02 | [P1] `/jobs` listing + `/jobs/[slug]` detail with JobPosting JSON-LD, filters by category/language; sourced from seeded sample jobs until FR-PRJ ships. | Google Rich Results test passes JobPosting on a job page. |
| FR-PUB-03 | [P1] `/freelancers` landing (earnings, tiers, testing, payout methods by country, FAQ + FAQPage schema). | Indexed-ready; meta standards met. |
| FR-PUB-04 | [P1] `/vendors` landing (RFP model, capability requirements, case-study links to eqourse.com). | Same standards. |
| FR-PUB-05 | [P1] `/about` trust page (parent-company story, certifications, security, contact). | Organization schema includes parentOrganization: eQOURSE. |
| FR-PUB-06 | [P1] `/login` + `/register` with role choice (Freelancer / Vendor) and country selector stub feeding FR-REG-11. | Role choice routes to the correct wizard placeholder; app routes noindex. |
| FR-SEO-01 | [P1] Programmatic SEO engine: auto-generated category×language landing pages, sitemap.xml regenerated on job publish, robots.txt blocking /app + /api, sitewide Organization + WebSite JSON-LD. | Publishing a seeded job updates sitemap.xml automatically; /app routes carry noindex. |

Ordering rule: FND-01→06 strictly sequential; PUB-01..06 then FR-SEO-01. FR-SEO-01 must not begin before FR-FND-01/05 are done.
